## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

I would mainly like to find the correlation of the demand of people renting a bike and the weather. One interesting data I notice is the windspeed, I would like to see how the windspeed can affect people's desire on renting a bike. The data also provide us to the information of whether the rentee is a registered user or not as well as the total amount of bike rented in the day. I will also love to see how they are related, how many percentage of people that is registered/not registered are renting the bike. At last, the data also showed us whether the rented date is a holiday, working day, or weekend. While we might think people tend to rent a bike more on weekend or holidays, the result might differ, and I would like to check that out as well. As mentioned previously, the correlation of windspeed and the amount of people rented on that date is what interests me the most in this data. While I am not familiar of what a Dashboard is, I would like to learn what that is and possibly make use of it.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The bike sharing datasheet is provided by a company called Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Decision Support (LIAAD), University of Porto. It is a data that shows us information related to bike rental including the instances, rented date, season, year, month, whether the rental is on a holiday, weekday or working day, also the weathersit displayed by numbers from 1-4. 1 means clear, few clouds, partly cloud and partly cloud. 2 means mist and cloudy, mist + broken clouds, mist + few clouds and mist. 3 means light snow, light rain + thunderstorm + scattered clouds or light rain + scattered clouds. 4 means heavy rain + ice pallets + thunderstorm + mist, snow + fog. The data also includes, the temperature, humidity, windspeed of the rental date. As well as whether the rentee is a casual user or a registered user, and last the total amount to rentals in that date. The data is collected in a two year time frame from January 1st, 2011 to December 31st, 2012. I believe the purpose of this dataset is to allow the bike rental company to tell the demand of the bike rental depending on the weather, date...etc. It can possibly help to know whether certain days need more supply or not. Last, the data is probably collected through a computer system that tracts each rental while also including the date's information.
